Learn [How to create WordPress tables from Excel files](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/creating-wpdatatables/creating-wpdatatables-from-excel/).

### Make Data Table from CSV

CSV is one of the most popular data formats—it's lightweight, easy to generate from almost any software, and even simple to create manually. With wpDataTables, you have more flexibility by using not just the standard ‘comma’ delimiter, but also ‘colon’, ‘semicolon’, ‘vertical bar (pipe)’, and ‘TAB’ options. [Creating WordPress tables from CSV files](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/creating-wpdatatables/creating-wpdatatables-from-csv/) has never been easier!

### Generate Data Table from XML

Easily generate data tables from XML, a universal standard for presenting data. Many web services rely on XML, and wpDataTables fully supports it as an input data source. Check out our documentation to learn [How to Create WordPress Tables with XML](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/creating-wpdatatables/creating-wpdatatables-from-xml/) and seamlessly integrate your data.

### Build WordPress Table from JSON

JSON has become the ‘de facto’ standard for packing data on the web and wpDataTables also supports the JSON format as an input data source.
Learn [How to create WordPress tables from JSON](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/creating-wpdatatables/creating-wpdatatables-from-json-input/).

### Create Data Table from Nested JSON

### JSON Authentication

Most of JSON APIs are locked, password protected, and can’t be accessed without some authentication. wpDataTables support basic authentication and also custom headers where you can provide details needed for authentication for that specific JSON (for example API keys, tokens, etc.). More info in our docs about [JSON Authentication](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/creating-wpdatatables/creating-wordpress-tables-from-nested-json-data-with-json-authentication/#json-authentication).

## How to Create Tables & Charts with WP Data Tables?

Creating tables, datatables and charts with a WordPress tables plugin has never been easier. It only takes 3 basic steps:

### Provide Table Data

Upload data from Excel, CSV, JSON, any API, XML, or Serialized PHP arrays, or start from scratch using the WordPress table builder.

### Customize Tables

Adjust columns, rename, reorder, apply CSS, change colors, hide on mobile, and fine-tune fonts, borders, rows, and pagination to fit your style.

### Publish Your Table

Once your table is ready, add it to any post or page with [Gutenberg](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/general/gutenberg-editor/), WP Editor, [shortcodes](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/general/wpdatatables-shortcodes/), or page builders like [Avada](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/general/avada-builder-integration/), [Divi](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/general/divi-builder-integration/), [WPBakery](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/table-features/visual-composer-integration/), and [Elementor](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/general/elementor-integration/).
